# Portfolio-lookup
Portfolio lookup API is useful for determining the stock ticker or symbol a company’s stock is traded with.
For example, Google’s symbol is GOOGL. Apple’s is AAPL. To use our APIs, a symbol is required as one of the inputs. This portfolio Lookup API response includes the company’s symbol, its full name, and the exchange it’s traded on.
